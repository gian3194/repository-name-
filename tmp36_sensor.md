  // to send text back to the main computer. For both sides to
  // communicate properly, they need to be set to the same speed.
  // We use the Serial.begin() function to initialize the port
  // and set the communications speed.
  
  // The speed is measured in bits per second, also known as
  // "baud rate". 9600 is a very commonly used baud rate,
  // and will transfer about 10 characters per second.

{
  // Up to now we've only used integer ("int") values in our
  // sketches. Integers are always whole numbers (0, 1, 23, etc.).
  // In this sketch, we'll use floating-point values ("float").
  // Floats can be fractional numbers such as 1.42, 2523.43121, etc.

  // We'll declare three floating-point variables
  // (We can declare multiple variables of the same type on one line:)

  float voltage, degreesC, degreesF;

  // First we'll measure the voltage at the analog pin. Normally
  // we'd use analogRead(), which returns a number from 0 to 1023.
  // Here we've written a function (further down) called
  // getVoltage() that returns the true voltage (0 to 5 Volts)
  // present on an analog input pin.

  voltage = getVoltage(temperaturePin);
  
  // Now we'll convert the voltage to degrees Celsius.
  // This formula comes from the temperature sensor datasheet:

  degreesC = (voltage - 0.5) * 100.0;
  
  // While we're at it, let's convert degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit.
  // This is the classic C to F conversion formula:
  
  degreesF = degreesC * (9.0/5.0) + 32.0;
  
  // Now we'll use the serial port to print these values
  // to the serial monitor!
  
  // To open the serial monitor window, upload your code,
  // then click the "magnifying glass" button at the right edge
  // of the Arduino IDE toolbar. The serial monitor window
  // will open.

  // (NOTE: remember we said that the communication speed
  // must be the same on both sides. Ensure that the baud rate
  // control at the bottom of the window is set to 9600. If it
  // isn't, change it to 9600.)
  
  // Also note that every time you upload a new sketch to the
  // Arduino, the serial monitor window will close. It does this
  // because the serial port is also used to upload code!
  // When the upload is complete, you can re-open the serial
  // monitor window.
  
  // To send data from the Arduino to the serial monitor window,
  // we use the Serial.print() function. You can print variables
  // or text (within quotes).

  Serial.print("voltage: ");
  Serial.print(voltage);
  Serial.print("  deg C: ");
  Serial.print(degreesC);
  Serial.print("  deg F: ");
  Serial.println(degreesF);

  // These statements will print lines of data like this:
  // "voltage: 0.73 deg C: 22.75 deg F: 72.96"

  // Note that all of the above statements are "print", except
  // for the last one, which is "println". "Print" will output
  // text to the SAME LINE, similar to building a sentence
  // out of words. "Println" will insert a "carriage return"
  // character at the end of whatever it prints, moving down
  // to the NEXT line.
   
  delay(1000); // repeat once per second (change as you wish!)
}


float getVoltage(int pin)
{
  // This function has one input parameter, the analog pin number
  // to read. You might notice that this function does not have
  // "void" in front of it; this is because it returns a floating-
  // point value, which is the true voltage on that pin (0 to 5V).
  
  // You can write your own functions that take in parameters
  // and return values. Here's how:
  
    // To take in parameters, put their type and name in the
    // parenthesis after the function name (see above). You can
    // have multiple parameters, separated with commas.
    
    // To return a value, put the type BEFORE the function name
    // (see "float", above), and use a return() statement in your code
    // to actually return the value (see below).
  
    // If you don't need to get any parameters, you can just put
    // "()" after the function name.
  
    // If you don't need to return a value, just write "void" before
    // the function name.

  // Here's the return statement for this function. We're doing
  // all the math we need to do within this statement:
  
  return (analogRead(pin) * 0.004882814);
  
  // This equation converts the 0 to 1023 value that analogRead()
  // returns, into a 0.0 to 5.0 value that is the true voltage
  // being read at that pin.
}

// Other things to try with this code:

//   Turn on an LED if the temperature is above or below a value.

//   Read that threshold value from a potentiometer - now you've
//   created a thermostat!
